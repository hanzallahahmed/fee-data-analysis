**Repository Name**: `fee-data-analysis`

**Description**:  
A Python project for analyzing and processing student fee submission data. This project is designed to load CSV datasets, merge student and fee records, and generate insights such as the most common fee submission dates. It supports both **parallel** and **linear processing** modes, allowing for flexibility depending on dataset size and processing needs. Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind, the script leverages Pandas for data manipulation and Pythonâ€™s `collections.Counter` for frequency analysis.

**Key Features**:
- Load and process student and fee datasets (`students.csv` and `fees.csv`).
- Merge data for comprehensive fee analysis.
- Identify the most common fee submission date and its frequency.
- Supports both parallel processing for faster performance and linear processing for simplicity and smaller datasets.
- Generate detailed frequency statistics for fee submission dates.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- Pandas
- Collections (Counter)
- Parallel Processing Tools (optional)

**Use Case**:  
It is ideal for data analysts or educational institutions aiming to understand patterns in student fee submissions. Choose between parallel or linear processing depending on the dataset size and computational resources.
